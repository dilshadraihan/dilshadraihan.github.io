I am currently a data scientist with Amazon Web Services (AWS). I received my PhD in Aerospace Engineering at Texas A&M University in May 2019. I was advised by Prof. Suman Chakravorty at the [estimation, decision and planning lab](http://edplab.org/people/). My research is in the areas of Statistical Signal Processing, Sensor Tasking and Machine Learning.
